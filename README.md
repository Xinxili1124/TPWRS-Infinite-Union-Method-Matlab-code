This RAR file contains twenty M files (including CaseStudy_A and CaseStudy_B) and two SLX files (CaseStudy_A), which are based on MATLAB 2024a. These files include the code and simulation models used in the paper TPWRS--2025. CaseStudy_A: Run the M file named "Infinite_Union_Method_case1" (take lambda=1.2 and lambda=1.4), and the original graphs of Fig.4 are obtained. Run the SLX file named "Infinite_Union_Method_case1", and the original graphs of Fig.5a,b are obtained. CaseStudy_A: Run the M file named "Infinite_Union_Method_case2" (take lambda=1.3, 1.5, 1.9 and 2.0), and the original graphs of Fig.6 are obtained. Run the SLX file named "Infinite_Union_Method_case2", and the original graphs of Fig.5c are obtained. CaseStudy_B: Run the M files located in 'Voltage stability limit estimation', named "IEEE9,IEEE14,...,IEEE123" (nine in total, adapted from the standard IEEE systems), then, the relative error of the output data is calculated and the original Table I can be obtained. CaseStudy_B: Run the M file located in 'Visualization of solvability region', named "IEEE9,IEEE14,...,IEEE123" (nine in total, adapted from the standard IEEE systems), the original graphs of Fig.7 are obtained. CaseStudy_B: Run the M file located in 'Voltage bound estimation', named "IEEE123root_locus" (adapted from the standard IEEE-123 bus system), the original graph of Fig.8 is obtained.
